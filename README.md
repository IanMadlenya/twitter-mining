<h1>General Description:</h1>
This project is a ML/NLP library in Java for analyzing tweets and building predictive models. The predictive models are built to help election/ad/marketing campaigns dig into social media conversations (public opinions) in order to get insights for making intelligent decisions.

The project consists of four main packages and a resource directory:
<ol>
<li><b>Algorithms</b> package contains implementations of a few ml/nlp algorithms for running text analysis on tweets contents.</li>
<li><b>Twitter</b> package is designed to wrap twitter data regradless of the persistent layer that one uses to store/retrieve tweets.</li>
<li><b>Runanalysis</b> package is the interface for running ml/nlp algorithms.</li>
<li><b>Utilities</b> package is developed to provide a collection of helper classes for different analysis.</li>
<li><b>Resources</b> directory includes a few data sources used for tweets analysis such as stop words, training data for sentiment analysis and so on.</li>
</ol>
